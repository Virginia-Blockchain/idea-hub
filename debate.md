# Idea Exchange

> A proposal to hold a debate/discussion/panel between myself and members of AIF, MII and/or SWS. The purpose of this exchange of ideas is to educate people in finance about blockchain technology, answer any open questions from curious students, and settle any misunderstandings.

## Proposed Format

1. Pitch debate where we go back and forth on pitching blockchain as a macro trend. We set speech times for each side. For this, we could set a criteria and even have the audience vote for a winner at the end (I am happy to be super flexible on the criteria).

2. Panel discussion where I might sit on a panel with skeptics and answer questions from a moderator and/or the audience.

## Reach Out List

* AIF -- Vamsi, Jeevan, Dakota, Calvin
* MII -- AJ, Nathan, Donny
* the girl club is SWS? I don't think I know anyone in it, but I can ask MII and AIF for help
